In this project, I generate fake lyrics for the Red Hot Chili Peppers using Keras and an LSTM RNN. Here is a quick read on this technique: https://towardsdatascience.com/recurrent-neural-networks-and-lstm-4b601dd822a5. I used BeautifulSoup to scrape Red Hot Chili Peppers lyrics from https://www.lyrics.com/ and the textgenrnn library for natural language generation.

I also included code at the bottom of my notebook to generate a dataframe of lyrics for most artists on lyrics.com. A few artists have a different layout for their page which is not compatible with my code. I hope you can make use of this code for yourself!
